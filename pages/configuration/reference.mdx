title: Configuration Reference
---

At the moment, Publica is entirely configured by environment variables. It is 
important to understand that any configuration change to environment variables
will require an application restart.

An example file of the most used configuration settings can be found here; [example publica.env file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Padilla-core/publica-app/main/.env.example)

## Required Settings

### `DATABASE_URL`

eg: `postgresql://publica-user:publica-password@localhost:5432/publica-db-local`

Postgres is not strictly necessary, Publica uses Prisma to connect to the database, so technically mariadb or other databases could be used.

### `REDIS_URL`

eg: `redis://localhost:6379`

### `JWT_SECRET`

A random string that should be unique for every installation, this is used to secure your JWT auth tokens.

### `FRONTEND_URL`

eg: `http://publica.example.lan:4200`

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`

eg: `http://publica.example.lan:3000`

### `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL`

If running everything in the same host/container: `http://localhost:3000`

## Social Media keys

See the "providers" section of the documentation for the provider you want to configure,
for details about how to set that up.
