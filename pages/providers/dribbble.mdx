### Register your application

[Register your application on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/account/applications/new).

* **Name:** `MyPublicaInstance`
* **Description:** `My Publica Instance`
* **Website:** `https://example.com`
* **Redirect URI:** (see below)

<OAuth2Redirect provider = "dribble" />

### Copy your client secret to environment variables

These can be found immediately after registering your application. These are both 64 characters long.


```env
DRIBBLE_CLIENT_ID="1234..."
DRIBBLE_CLIENT_SECRET="5678..."
```

Restart Publica with the updated environment variables

### Add a Dribbble channel in the Publica web interface

Go to the Publica web interface, and click on the "Add Channel" button. Select "Dribbble" from the list of available channels. You should be redirected to Dribbble to authorize the application.
