<Callout>
This integration requires that you have a Google account.
</Callout>

Follow the instructions as availabe in the [Obtaining authorization credentials](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).

<Steps>

### Step 1 Go to Credentials Page
Make sure you are logged in to your Google account and visit the [Credentials - APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/credentials) page. Make sure to read the terms and conditions and "Agree and Continue".

### Step 2 Create Project
Create a new project by clicking on the "Create Project" button.

### Step 3
Fill in the project name, and details and click "Create".

### Step 4 Create OAuth Credentials
Create credentials by clicking on the "Create Credentials" button. Select the "OAuth client ID" option.

### Step 5 Configure Consent Screen
Make sure that your consent screen has been configured. Add yourself as a test user of the application.

### Step 6 Fill in OAuth Details
Create the OAuth client ID. Select "Web application" as the application type and fill in the details.

Under "Authorized redirect URIs", insert your OAuth2 Redirect URI.

### Add a Redirect URI

<OAuth2Redirect provider = "youtube" />

The redirect URI is the URL that YouTube will redirect to after you have logged in. Assuming you are running Postiz on `postiz.example.com`, this would be: `https://postiz.example.com/integrations/social/youtube`. Alternatively if you are running on `localhost:4200`, this would be `http://localhost:4200/integrations/social/youtube`. You only really need one of these, depending on where you are running Postiz.

You can find this in the **OAuth2** section of the Discord Developer Portal.

### Step 7 Activate YouTubes API
Go to Activated APIs and Services. Then click on Activate APIs and Services. Search YouTube Data API v3 and activate the API by clicking it and clicking Activate.
Do the same Process with YouTube Analytics API and YouTube Reporting API.

</Steps>

After following all of the steps above you should be met with a screen that shows your client ID and client secret. Add these to your providers configuration.

```env
YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID=""
YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```

ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR BRAND ACCOUNTS
Note: When using a Brand account you will need to set your APP to External and setup a test user.
You do not need to publish the APP, but it does take time for the changes to propegate. 
You will also need to add the app to the trusted apps within your google workspace Admin. 

### Step 1 Go to admin.google.com
sign in

### Step 2 go to Security --> Access and data Controls --> API Controls
Click Manage Third Party App Access

### Step 3 Click Configure new App
Put your Client ID for the app you created in previous steps into the search box and select your app

### Step 4 Set scopes and Google Data Access for the app to Trusted
Once set, click save

### Step 5 Wait at least 5 hours for the changes to propegate.
After this time you should now be able to add your Youtube channel to your Postiz account
