## Docker Compose

This guide assumes that you have docker installed, with a reasonable amount of resources to run Publica. This Docker Compose setup has been tested with;

- Virtual Machine, Ubuntu 24.04, 4Gb RAM, 2 vCPUs.

<Prereqs />

### Configuration uses environment variables

The docker containers for Publica are entirely configured with environment variables.

- **Option A** - environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file
- **Option B** - environment variables in a `Publica.env` file mounted in `/config` for the Publica container only
- **Option C** - environment variables in a `.env` file next to your `docker-compose.yml` file (not recommended).

... or a mixture of the above options!

There is a [configuration reference](/configuration/reference/) page with a list
of configuration settings.

## Example `docker-compose.yml` file

```yaml
services:
  Publica:
    image: ghcr.io/gitroomhq/Publica-app:latest
    container_name: Publica
    restart: always
    environment:
      # You must change these. Replace `Publica.your-server.com` with your DNS name - this needs to be exactly the URL you're accessing Publica on.
      MAIN_URL: "https://Publica.your-server.com"
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://Publica.your-server.com"
      NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL: "https://Publica.your-server.com/api"
      JWT_SECRET: "random string that is unique to every install - just type random characters here!"

      # These defaults are probably fine, but if you change your user/password, update it in the
      # Publica-postgres or Publica-redis services below.
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://Publica-user:Publica-password@Publica-postgres:5432/Publica-db-local"
      REDIS_URL: "redis://Publica-redis:6379"
      BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
      IS_GENERAL: "true" # Required for self-hosting.
      # The container images are pre-configured to use /uploads for file storage.
      # You probably should not change this unless you have a really good reason!
      STORAGE_PROVIDER: "local"
      UPLOAD_DIRECTORY: "/uploads"
      NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY: "/uploads"
    volumes:
      - Publica-config:/config/
      - Publica-uploads:/uploads/
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    networks:

        condition: service_healthy

  Publica-postgres:
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    container_name: Publica-postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Publica-password
      POSTGRES_USER: Publica-user
      POSTGRES_DB: Publica-db-local
    volumes:
      - postgres-volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - Publica-network
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U Publica-user -d Publica-db-local
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
  Publica-redis:
    image: redis:7.2
    container_name: Publica-redis
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: redis-cli ping
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
    volumes:
      - Publica-redis-data:/data
    networks:
      - Publica-network


volumes:
  postgres-volume:
    external: false

  Publica-redis-data:
    external: false

  Publica-config:
    external: false

  Publica-uploads:
    external: false

networks:
  Publica-network:
    external: false
```

## How to use docker compose

Save the file contents to `docker-compose.yml` in your directory you create for Publica.

Run `docker compose up` to start the services.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note** When you change variables, you must run `docker compose down` and
  then `docker compose up` to recreate these containers with these updated
  variables.
</Callout>

Look through the logs for startup errors, and if you have problems, check out the [support](/support/) page.

If everything looks good, then you can access the Publica web interface at https://Publica.your-server.com
