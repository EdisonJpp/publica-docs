This page briefly explains how to use Caddy to reverse proxy Publica. A configuration file example is below;

## Example Caddyfile

```caddy Caddyfile
publica.example.lan {
        reverse_proxy * localhost:5000
        tls internal
}
```

In this example, we have a single port for Publica, port 5000, which is the internal proxy built into the Docker container images. The `tls internal` directive is used to enable internal TLS for secure communication.

You will need to install the certificate into your browser with this configuration. If you are hosting on a public domain, Caddy allows you to use LetsEncrypt for automatic certificate management. For more information, refer to the [Caddy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/).

## Publica configuration

To ensure that Publica works correctly behind a reverse proxy, you may need to adjust its configuration in your .env file / environment variables. The following variables should be set to the correct values:

```bash
MAIN_URL="https://publica.example.lan"
FRONTEND_URL="https://publica.example.lan"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="https://publica.example.lan/api"
```
